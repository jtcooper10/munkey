# Munkey
## A peer-to-peer cryptographic password manager

**Munkey** is a cryptographic password manager which allows local devices to sync automatically, no internet connection required!

It is essentially a desktop password manager (like [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)) with the built-in reconciliation mechanisms of cloud-based password managers (like [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)).
With a locally-distributed password vault, you'll never have to worry about trusting a cloud-based provider to keep your vault information safe.
